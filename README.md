# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project is focused on performing sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data using techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
- **Model Training**: Using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or deep learning models (e.g., LSTM) for training.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Classify unseen data into appropriate sentiment categories.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/subbu2526/Sentiment-analysis.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
```bash
cd Sentiment-analysis
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the main script with your input file:
```bash
python main.py --input your_input_file.txt
```
Replace `your_input_file.txt` with your own dataset.

## Results

After training, you will get a model that can predict the sentiment of a given text. Example output:
```
Input: "I love this product!"
Output: Positive
```
